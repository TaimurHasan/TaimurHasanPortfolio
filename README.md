# Taimur Hasan - Professional Portfolio
## Description

Welcome to my professional portfolio repository!

The link below will take you to the website hosting my portfolio, where you will find timely insights and updates on my career path and recent projects. The website contains the main sections as follows:
- About Me - a brief paragraph about who I am, what I currently do, and what my main goal is
- Projects & Work - a few of my key projects so far, which I am proud to showcase, along with placeholders for projects that are not currently hosted on GitHub
- Contact Me - a section highlighting a few different avenues to get in contact with me as well as some links to my professional digital presence

## Application Details

The application was built using HTML to structure the web page and its various sections and CSS to add important styling details. Within CSS, I used advanced CSS language to ensure the website met the acceptance criteria listed below. Some key components of this website include direct links to my key projects and responsive layouts to allow users to view the site on various screens and devices.

**Languages Used**
- HTML
- CSS

**User Story:** <br />
AS AN employer <br />
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br />
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br />

**Acceptance Criteria:** <br />
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br />
WHEN I load their portfolio<br />
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br />
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br />
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br />
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br />
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br />
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br />
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br />
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br />
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br />
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br />
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br />
